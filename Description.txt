Brain Tumor Detection Using MRI Images
This project developed by Shrihari S, Vignesh P, Vignesh T aims to develop an automated system for detecting brain tumors in MRI images using machine learning and image processing techniques. By preprocessing the MRI scans, extracting key features, and applying machine learning algorithms, the system will classify images as either 'Tumor' or 'No Tumor'. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals by providing a fast, accurate, and reliable tool for early detection, which can improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes. The project will utilize Python, along with libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn, to create a machine learning model that is validated and optimized for performance. A user-friendly interface will be developed to allow easy upload and analysis of MRI scans, making the detection process faster and more efficient.
